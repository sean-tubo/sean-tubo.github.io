##2020: The Year that Defined a Generation 

by Sean Tubo

What is the Gen-Z equivalent of American Pie?

For my late Gen-X boss, and former it was a foundational pillar in the stoner comedy genre, and for his world as a whole. Before that it was Cheech and Chong. Before that it was Some Like It Hot. 

So what is the Gen-z equivalent? My first thought is the work of Seth Rogan, Adam Sandler, etc. But that isn't quite right. That was the millennials cultural cache. Those movies only still hold so much cultural cache because pop-culture has been frozen since the 2000s when Josh Whedon cast a powerful hex on the American public.

Is there a Gen-Z equivalent? Maybe not. Maybe the death of the stoner film coincided with the death of the stoner as an archetype. Weed is legal now, and mostly socially acceptable. Being a stoner isn't enough to be it's own personality trait because we all intrinsically understand on some level that being "successful" is rapidly going from a dream-big personal goal to a bare minimum requisite for even a mildly pleasant adult life.

Look to the death of the beach bum for a more direct example. What once was an established archetype of a mostly washout young man coasting on the back of seasonal work and the good will of a large social network has disappeared. Now you're either homeless, or that network has to be meticulously groomed and curated year-round through social media, completely defeating the purpose of being a bum who lives in a van- which is that you don't work. The professor who taught me the most about the current societal collapse would probably call this an indicator of especially high "precarity", meaning the risk that someone's otherwise stable life could collapse at any disaster.

So maybe the stoner comedy has disappeared because we don't have the time to watch stupid movies. But what else are stoner comedies?

For one thing, they're mildly counter-cultural, or at least edgy, which is important too. Funny enough to be safe from censorship, but also a little bit in the way of whatever the current push towards conservatism is. Seth Rogan is the farthest thing from being a revolutionary, but he at least presents a world where being a worthless loser is valuable and even envious. That can be very important.

I think our equivalent might be TikTok, but if it is that's really bad, because the government just moved to censor it. That's a step beyond being rated R. 

It does fit a lot of the boxes. It's culturally uniting for Gen Z, even if you haven't interacted with it yourself. It is, in aggregate, a little but funny, a little bit stupid, and a little bit counter-cultural.

But what does that mean for us. What does it mean to have a shared media culture spread across 1 million different points like some horrible screaming spider. American Pie made up of a thousand tiny clout chasing pieces. I can't ask my peers "have they seen this movie", but I can ask them if they've seen an edit of a meme of a video that went viral that will someday enter the collective consciousness as a phrase half invented and half stolen from black culture.

Allow me to clarify I am not imply the internet is somehow uniquely, horribly, rotting our brains. I am simply asking a question, and trying to consider the implications. What is our Woodstock? What is our American Pie? 

If there is one defining event of our generation, it was COVID, although everybody I talk to seems to have a collective amnesia about it. It isn't that it's talked around, it's hardly even talked about. It leaves jagged lines in the corner of your vision.

In 20 years will we all look back on the year we spent in isolation with fond memories? I think the lack of shared memory speaks to a genuine generational trauma we are only now beginning to unpack. 

Think of all the people that went absolutely crazy during COVID, the q-anons, the conspiracists, Shane Dawson. How close were all of us, young and far more psychologically resilient, to that? What is the percentage of a mental break down when it begins to show visible effects. 30% of the way there? 40%? How many of us are walking wounded.

I know that when I can trace the bodily feeling of some of my deepest darkest depressions, I'm back in my room that year. I've been depressed all my life, but that year has to be the worst. That wasn't just chemical imbalance. That was a genuinely harmful outside stimulus causing my brain to just give up. And it's one I can say that without a doubt we all experienced on some level. Whether it felt easier or harder, shorter or longer. 

It's hard to remember, but we all had a lot hope before that. Do we remember this? We were the most progressive generation yet and we were really proud of it. Are we now? Well we have the mano-sphere. And Twitter discourse. And a lot of young women who really really wanna be stay at home moms with no job and no escape plan. 

The hippies had free love at least. We can't even stop doing discourse about polyamory. I remember coming out of COVID a lot of that hope seemed gone, or at least stunted. We were still trying, but there was an uncomfortable desperation to it. 

And what did we do over COVID? We used TikTok. More than ever before. It was our defining cultural media and yet the actual specifics seem to have slipped away. All we have is the aggregate, the memory of a memory. I don't think there is a Gen-Z American Pie. I don't think it's possible right now. 

Pop culture is split between nostalgia and ephemerality, used to be or won't be soon. Any possibility of true cultural touchstones are just too much, too concrete in a world that feels increasingly abstract. An American Pie would feel hollow somehow, too simple when the only expectation is that everything is just a little too complex.

I think the idea that any one moment, or idea, or piece of art could define us, even in a way as simple as being THE stoner comedy is a little bit flinch-inducing. It calls to mind definitions which we absolutely don't want.

Terrified. Alone. Hopeless.

Or maybe it's that first thing about stoners just not really existing anymore. Maybe it's DUNE. Yeah the movie about a young man facing incredible personal challenges while he works to fight fascism that also is about him succumbing to fascism. That's awesome. Did you read the books?

Yeah they're way better, see Frank Herbert actually included a lot of internal monologue and lore-
