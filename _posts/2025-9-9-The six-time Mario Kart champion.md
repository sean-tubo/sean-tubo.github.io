Fourth year cinematic arts and technology major Cejaye Erickson is the five, now six-time winner of the CSUMB semesterly Mario Kart tournament. A streak which as of Aug. 28 stands unbeaten for the fourth year in a row.

The story of every great sports superstar needs two things. The first is unrivaled dominance in their era. The second is much rarer. Destiny.

Erickson has both. His story starts his freshman year, in the very ballroom where he clinched his sixth victory. A freshman Erickson -only a week or so into his college career- would win a Nintendo Switch at the annual Monte Royale casino night, one in a thousand odds which would set him on the path to his 4 year streak. “The only reason I’m good at Mario Kart is because freshman year me and my friends won the switch at the Monte Royale casino night,” said Erickson.

Erickson is very, very good at playing Mario Kart: but you wouldn’t know just looking at him. Event organizer Dan Burfiend became aware of Erickson during his time running the tournaments. He describes him as an “undefeated champion”, but also as a “normal looking guy, humble.” 

Erickson is tall, yet quiet and soft spoken, maybe even shy. He has short messy hair which falls just over his face. His build implies an athletic background, as does the supreme calm and poise he carries himself with. He wears a Yoshi mask (provided to all the guests by the organizers) half cocked over his face, a homage to the character he races with. 

Erickson doesn’t try to draw attention to himself, although it follows him around anyway. Even people who have never seen him before take notice, whispering to each other about the shockingly good player decimating the early bracket. 

Erickson (black Yoshi) so far ahead the map isn't clear if he's winning or losing. 

In an interview before the tournament, he is loath to talk about himself. He isn't boasting exactly, but there's a hint of levity and even controlled arrogance in his short answers. “How are you so good at Mario Kart?”, “Practice and hard work,” says Erickson. 

After bringing the Switch home his friends, four of them together , would spend the next years of their life playing Mario Kart with what a friend and rival Emelio Careon would describe as “religious fervor.” One of those roommates, fourth-year kinesiology major Nate Lewit describes the process as “iron sharpening iron.” 

Those three roommates are characters in themselves, a hype team who, according to Burfeind, would regularly dominate the bracket and take over the finals. 

Tonight is a little more somber- only Lewit could make an appearance. “We used to have more people- now everyone is busy. We’re kind of the last two guys left,” said Lewit. When asked about Erickson, Lewit makes the comparison to greatness himself,  “He’s kind of like Lebron: because he has so much longevity. Ever since we were freshmen, he’s won the tournament.” 

Lewit is next to Erickson for most of the tournament, half coach, half one-man hype squad.

“I can’t miss this. I gotta be there to cheer him on,” said Lewit.

Whereas Lewit is giddy and excited, Erickson is totally unshakeable. His opponents in the first round spend the time between races nervously clutching their controllers, Erickson casually checks his phone and watches (or scouts out) the other races. 

Erickson isn’t immune to the pressure, but like the greats, he only seems driven by it. “Every time you win there’s more pressure,” said Erickson.

The tournament is in a bracket format, divided into three rounds. The tensest is the second, where the competition is fiercer and there’s no chance for a consolation bracket. As he waits for his race to begin, Erickson clutches his hands and watches his opponents race with lethal intensity.


Here’s one more quality he has in common with the greats. “I hate losing,” said Erickson. 

Before the second bracket, Careon - friend but also competitor- shakes his hand, “I just wanna race you in the finals one more time.” 

He wins the first two races of the finals by almost as big a margin as in the first bracket, but the third map is a dogfight, his opponents still in striking distance of a tie. The race is on Grumble Volcano, a map filled with sinking earth and erupting volcanoes. A few spots of bad luck put Erickson in sixth place on the third lap, well behind the head of the pack.

Mario Kart, like real racing, is a game of inches. The best players take every advantage they can, driving near perfectly, always in the right position.

Erickson takes these edges better than anyone. He corners tighter, uses his items perfectly, never spins out on the starting gun.

 “You’re fighting for second,” said Careon, “you may be close but if you mess up one turn? CeJaye’s already gone. He knows exactly what lines to take and he just vanishes.”

Halfway through the third lap, luck turns back his way. Two good items fall into his lap, a speed boosting mushroom which allows him to race through a dangerous part of the course and three powerful red shells which seek and stun the opponent ahead. In just two turns, he’s closely trailing the pack

Just for a second, he allows himself to bask in the victory. “He does a certain smile, when he knows he has it in the bag a smile will come up and he just chuckles a bit,” said Careon.

It’s a photo finish, and he uses the last red shell to barely snag first place. The fourth and final race is now just a formality, but he still wins by a huge margin. It’s a perfect victory, 60/60 possible points. 

He collects his winning prize, a Mario Lego Set, stands for a picture, and collects himself to go home. 

“Just another day, just another day. We’ll be back next semester,” said Erickson.
