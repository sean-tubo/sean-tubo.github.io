## Writing Waves Project Journal #2

A shorter day today, mostly spent on ironing out final decisions and small logistics needs so we can get started on the editing work properly. I talked to the editing team and decided on our internal editing process (when, where, why and how we are handling edits), combined with the policy team to decide how we want to accept submissions, finalized the email templates, email list, and reached out to all our submissions from batch 1 and 2. We decided on some final deadlines including when to open (and close) new submissions and shared that with the social media and policy team. We are now working on batch 3 and are well on our way to having the editing process done before week 11 (our deadline). With most of the kinks worked out the only thing left to do is to assign individual editors to each piece next week and let everyone get to work. That will be in the back of my mind this week as I also go through batch 3 so I can lead the discussion on that next Monday. The continuous process of social media outreach is now the main focus, I will be trying to keep an eye on that, but I also understand they have been mostly autonomous and I want to respect that. After a furious couple weeks the tedium is (mostly) over and now all that remains is keeping the spreadsheet up to date and checking in on my editors to see how they are coming along.
